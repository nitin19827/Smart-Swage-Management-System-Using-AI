Smart Sewage Blockage Detection

This repository contains a dataset related to sewage, including parameters such as hardness, sulfur, carbon, and more. I applied several machine learning algorithms, including random forest, decision tree, SVM, AdaBoost classifier, and others. After comparing their performance, I selected the best algorithm, which turned out to be the random forest algorithm, as it provided the highest accuracy.
